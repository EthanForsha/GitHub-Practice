# GitHub-Practice

These are the steps I used to recreate the Repository graph. The numbers
in parenthesis are the steps corresponding with those in the assignment graph.

1. Created new repository called GITHUB-PRACTICE and made a new branch called 1st-Branch. (0)

2. Created STEPS file in main. (1)

3. Added an image to main. (2)

4. Worked on new branch README file. (3)

5. Edited README file in new branch. Created a second new branch called 2nd-Branch. (4)

6. Added STEPS file in new branch to create a merge conflict. Merged main into new branch using main STEPS. (5)

7. Updated STEPS file in first new branch. (6)

8. Second new branch created off of step 4. (7)

9. Added BUG FIX.txt to second new branch. (8)

10. Added sample text to BUG FIX.txt in second branch. (9)

11. Renamed image file in main branch to "CS MEME". (10)

12. Updated STEPS file in first new branch to include steps 7-11. Merged experimental bug fix branch (second new branch) with bug fix branch (first new branch). (11)

13. Updated BUG FIX TEST file to include sample code to simulate that the experimental bug fix has been implemented. (12)

14. Added a new folder called CODE to main and added SAMPLE CODE.txt file to folder to simulate code in the repository. Merged 1st-branch into main branch. (13)

15. Updated STEPS file to be updated with all of the STEPS used to recreate the graph in the assignment.
